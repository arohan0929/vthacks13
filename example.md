Submission Date: October 1, 2025
Proposed Funder: Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program

1.0 Executive Summary
Project AETHER WATCH proposes the development of a novel artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) framework to enhance Space Domain Awareness (SDA). Our primary objective is to create and validate algorithms capable of analyzing satellite telemetry data in near-real-time to identify Cyber-Suspicious Indicators (CSI). By detecting subtle deviations in satellite behavior indicative of potential cyber threats, this project will provide a critical early-warning capability, contributing directly to the security and resilience of national space assets. This proposal seeks funding to support a 24-month research and development effort, leveraging the unique expertise of Purdue University's Advanced Signal Processing Lab. This work is proposed as a subcontract under the DTIC IAC's multiple-award contract for research and development, aligning with its mission to provide technical expertise in critical defense areas. The partnership builds upon Purdue's established relationship with industry leaders in national security, including a recent initiative with AMERICAN SYSTEMS to advance space security.  
2.0 Technical Approach
The core of Project AETHER WATCH is a hybrid AI model combining recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for time-series analysis of telemetry streams with a graph neural network (GNN) to model inter-satellite communications and relationships. The methodology involves three phases:
Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Data Ingestion and Model Scaffolding. We will develop a robust data pipeline to process the government-furnished dataset. The initial AI model architecture will be constructed.
Phase 2 (Months 7-18): Algorithm Training and Refinement. The model will be trained on the provided dataset to establish a baseline of normal satellite behavior. We will then introduce simulated anomaly data to train the CSI detection capabilities.
Phase 3 (Months 19-24): Validation and Reporting. The model's performance will be rigorously tested and validated. Final reports and a prototype software deliverable will be prepared.
3.0 Data Management
The project will utilize a significant dataset of proprietary satellite telemetry provided by the Department of Defense (DoD). This dataset is designated as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and contains sensitive operational parameters. All project data, including the CUI dataset, intermediate processing files, and resulting models, will be stored securely on the university's central cloud infrastructure, which utilizes a standard commercial AWS tenant. Access will be managed by the university's IT services according to standard research protocols.
4.0 Collaboration and Peer Review
To ensure the scientific rigor of our algorithmic development, we have established a collaboration with Dr. Alistair Smith, a leading expert in statistical signal processing at the University of Manchester, UK. Dr. Smith will assist in the validation of our core algorithms, providing an independent peer review of our methodology and results. This international collaboration is vital for achieving state-of-the-art performance.
5.0 Personnel
The project team comprises faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students with extensive experience in AI/ML and satellite systems.

Principal Investigator: Dr. Eleanor Vance
1. Data Description: The primary data for this project consists of satellite telemetry records provided by the Department of Defense. This data is classified as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). The data includes orbital parameters, subsystem health status, and communications logs. Secondary data will be generated by the project, including trained AI/ML models, model outputs, and performance metrics. This generated data is also considered CUI and ITAR-controlled.
2. Data Storage and Preservation: All research data will be stored on the Purdue University central cloud storage system, provisioned through AWS. Data will be backed up nightly according to standard university IT procedures. The project anticipates generating approximately 5 TB of data over its 24-month lifecycle.
3. Access and Security: Access to the research data will be limited to project personnel as listed in the grant proposal. The Principal Investigator will be responsible for authorizing access. User authentication is managed via the university's single sign-on (SSO) system.
4. Data Sharing: Results of the research will be shared with the project sponsor, AMERICAN SYSTEMS, through contractually obligated deliverables. Public dissemination of the data or results is prohibited due to the sensitive nature of the information.
(NOTE: The document ends here. It is visibly incomplete and lacks critical sections required for handling CUI, such as: Incident Response Plan, Media Sanitization and Disposal, System Security Plan (SSP) reference, Audit and Accountability Measures, and specific technical controls for data protection.)

Part 3: Internal Policies and Communications
3.1 University Information Security Policy
Format: PDF Document
Purdue University - Policy IT-SEC-01
Title: Information Security and Data Classification
Effective Date: July 1, 2023
1.0 Purpose This policy establishes a framework for classifying and protecting the university's information assets to manage risk and comply with applicable laws and regulations.
2.0 Data Classification Levels All university data must be classified into one of the following three levels:
Level 1: Public Data. Information intended for public disclosure.
Level 2: Internal Data. Information not intended for the public but which can be shared widely within the university community.
Level 3: Restricted Data. Highly sensitive information protected by law, regulation, or university policy. Examples include student records (FERPA), health information (HIPAA), and personally identifiable information (PII). Access to Restricted Data must be limited to individuals with a legitimate need-to-know.
3.0 Security Requirements
3.1 Access Control: Access to university information systems is granted based on the principle of least privilege.
3.2 Password Policy: All user accounts must have a password that is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords must be changed every 180 days.
3.3 Data Encryption: All laptops and mobile devices used to store or access Level 3 (Restricted) data must have full-disk encryption enabled.
4.0 Policy Enforcement Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or expulsion.
(NOTE: This policy is a generic university document. It lacks any mention of CUI, ITAR, NIST SP 800-171, or CMMC. It does not mandate multifactor authentication (MFA), continuous monitoring, audit logging, or the creation of a System Security Plan (SSP), all of which are fundamental requirements for CMMC Level 2.)

4.2 ITAR "Deemed Export" Rule Summary
Format: Markdown Document
ITAR Compliance Brief: The "Deemed Export" Rule
What is ITAR?
The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) is a set of U.S. government regulations that control the export of defense-related articles and services. Its goal is to safeguard U.S. national security and further U.S. foreign policy objectives. Items controlled by ITAR are found on the United States Munitions List (USML).  
What is an "Export"?
Under ITAR, an "export" is not just shipping a physical item overseas. It also includes releasing or otherwise transferring "technical data" to a foreign person, whether in the United States or abroad.
The "Deemed Export" Rule
The core of the rule is simple: releasing controlled technical data to a foreign person within the United States is "deemed" to be an export to that person's country or countries of citizenship.
Technical Data: This includes information required for the design, development, production, manufacture, assembly, operation, repair, testing, maintenance, or modification of defense articles. This can be blueprints, formulas, source code, or engineering specifications.
Foreign Person: A foreign person is anyone who is not a U.S. citizen, not a lawful permanent resident (i.e., not a "Green Card" holder), and not a protected individual (e.g., a refugee or person with asylum).
Release: A "release" of technical data can happen through visual inspection, oral communication, or by providing access to a system or file containing the data.
Why It Matters for Project AETHER WATCH
The algorithms, source code, and technical specifications developed under the project are defined as USML Category XV articles.
Providing a non-U.S. Person, such as a foreign national graduate student, with access to this technical data constitutes a deemed export.
This action requires an export license from the Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) before access is granted.
Failure to obtain a license before the release occurs is a serious violation of federal law, carrying severe civil and criminal penalties.
Key Takeaway
You cannot provide a foreign national team member with access to ITAR-controlled source code or technical data without first securing a proper export license. The location of the person (i.e., on campus in the U.S.) does not matter.
