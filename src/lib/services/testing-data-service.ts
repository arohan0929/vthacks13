Part 1: Project Scoping and Contractual Basis
1.1 Research Grant Proposal
Format: PDF Document
Cover Page
Project Title: Project AETHER WATCH: AI-Driven Anomaly Detection for Enhanced Space Domain Awareness
Submitting Institution: Purdue University, Advanced Signal Processing Lab
Principal Investigator: Dr. Eleanor Vance
Co-Investigators: Dr. Samuel Carter
Submission Date: October 1, 2025
Proposed Funder: Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program

1.0 Executive Summary
Project AETHER WATCH proposes the development of a novel artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) framework to enhance Space Domain Awareness (SDA). Our primary objective is to create and validate algorithms capable of analyzing satellite telemetry data in near-real-time to identify Cyber-Suspicious Indicators (CSI). By detecting subtle deviations in satellite behavior indicative of potential cyber threats, this project will provide a critical early-warning capability, contributing directly to the security and resilience of national space assets. This proposal seeks funding to support a 24-month research and development effort, leveraging the unique expertise of Purdue University's Advanced Signal Processing Lab. This work is proposed as a subcontract under the DTIC IAC's multiple-award contract for research and development, aligning with its mission to provide technical expertise in critical defense areas. The partnership builds upon Purdue's established relationship with industry leaders in national security, including a recent initiative with AMERICAN SYSTEMS to advance space security.

2.0 Technical Approach
The core of Project AETHER WATCH is a hybrid AI model combining recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for time-series analysis of telemetry streams with a graph neural network (GNN) to model inter-satellite communications and relationships. The methodology involves three phases:
Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Data Ingestion and Model Scaffolding. We will develop a robust data pipeline to process the government-furnished dataset. The initial AI model architecture will be constructed.
Phase 2 (Months 7-18): Algorithm Training and Refinement. The model will be trained on the provided dataset to establish a baseline of normal satellite behavior. We will then introduce simulated anomaly data to train the CSI detection capabilities.
Phase 3 (Months 19-24): Validation and Reporting. The model's performance will be rigorously tested and validated. Final reports and a prototype software deliverable will be prepared.

3.0 Data Management
The project will utilize a significant dataset of proprietary satellite telemetry provided by the Department of Defense (DoD). This dataset is designated as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and contains sensitive operational parameters. All project data, including the CUI dataset, intermediate processing files, and resulting models, will be stored securely on the university's central cloud infrastructure, which utilizes a standard commercial AWS tenant. Access will be managed by the university's IT services according to standard research protocols.

4.0 Collaboration and Peer Review
To ensure the scientific rigor of our algorithmic development, we have established a collaboration with Dr. Alistair Smith, a leading expert in statistical signal processing at the University of Manchester, UK. Dr. Smith will assist in the validation of our core algorithms, providing an independent peer review of our methodology and results. This international collaboration is vital for achieving state-of-the-art performance.

5.0 Personnel
The project team comprises faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students with extensive experience in AI/ML and satellite systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------ END OF NOTES

ITAR Compliance Brief: The algorithms, source code, and technical specifications developed under the project are defined as USML Category XV articles. Providing a non-U.S. Person, such as a foreign national graduate student, with access to this technical data constitutes a deemed export. This action requires an export license from the Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) before access is granted.

Key compliance issues identified:
- Li Chen (PRC citizen) listed as non-U.S. Person requiring export license for ITAR data access
- Collaboration with Dr. Smith at University of Manchester requires DDTC export license
- All algorithms and source code subject to deemed export restrictions
- Email correspondence shows potential technical data sharing without proper export controls

CMMC Level 2 Requirements:
- 110 security controls from NIST SP 800-171
- Current implementation gaps in MFA deployment, audit log immutability, incident response procedures
- 7 of 10 tested controls passing with partial implementations noted
- Critical gaps in access control, audit accountability, and system protection

Risk Assessment:
- Medium likelihood, High impact: Non-U.S. Person access to ITAR code/data
- Low likelihood, High impact: Egress to foreign validation service enabled by default
- Medium likelihood, Medium impact: Incomplete DMP for CUI specifics
- Medium likelihood, High impact: Audit log immutability not proven

Current compliance readiness estimated at 65% with technical infrastructure largely in place but policy gaps in international collaboration procedures and access controls for foreign nationals.`;
