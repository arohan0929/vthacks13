# Compliance Copilot: AI-Native Academic Compliance Platform

## Executive Summary

Compliance Copilot transforms compliance assessment from a 3-week, $50K consultant process into a 3-minute AI-powered checkup. By leveraging Google Gemini's multimodal capabilities, it democratizes enterprise-grade compliance for academic environments - research labs, student organizations, course projects, and campus startups.

## Core Vision

**"Upload everything, get instant compliance clarity"**

Rather than filling forms or following rigid workflows, users simply describe their project and upload any relevant documents. AI instantly identifies applicable compliance frameworks, assesses current compliance levels, and provides step-by-step remediation with zero compliance expertise required.

## Feature Architecture

### 1. Universal Input Processor
**The Single Point of Entry**

#### Core Functionality
- **Multimodal Document Ingestion**
  - PDFs (policies, research proposals, grant applications)
  - Code repositories (data handling, API endpoints, privacy implementations)
  - Images (screenshots, diagrams, flowcharts)
  - Text descriptions (project summaries, research goals)
  - Emails/communications (vendor agreements, collaboration plans)

#### AI Processing Pipeline
- **Content Extraction**: OCR, code parsing, natural language understanding
- **Context Mapping**: Identify project type, data flows, stakeholder relationships
- **Semantic Analysis**: Understand intent vs. implementation gaps
- **Risk Signal Detection**: Flag high-risk activities (PII collection, international data transfer, minors involvement)

#### Technical Implementation
```

```
Compliance Score = (Implemented Requirements / Total Requirements) √ó 100
Risk Weight = (Potential Impact √ó Likelihood of Violation)
Priority Ranking = Risk Weight √ó Ease of Implementation
```

#### Visual Dashboard Components

- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language, not rigid forms
- **Learning Adaptation**: Improve questions based on user feedback

#### Question Categories
- **Implementation Reality Checks**
  - "Your policy mentions data encryption - what specific encryption standards do you use?"
  - "You collect student emails - do you have explicit consent workflows?"

- **Gap Filling**
  - "Who is your designated FERPA officer?"
  - "What's your data retention schedule?"

- **Risk Clarification**
  - "Are any research participants under 18?"
  - "Do you share data with international collaborators?"

### 5. Dynamic Compliance Tracker
**Real-Time Progress Monitoring**

#### Live Compliance Dashboard
- **Framework Breakdown**: Individual progress per requirement
- **Overall Health Score**: Weighted compliance across all applicable frameworks
- **Trend Analysis**: Compliance improvement/degradation over time
- **Critical Alerts**: Immediate attention items

#### Progress Visualization
